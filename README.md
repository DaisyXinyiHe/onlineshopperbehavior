# onlineshopperbehavior

The project is originally developed as a FourthBrain Machine Learning training program midterm. 

This project is to use machine learning models to analyze online shoppers behaviors and predict purchase behavior. 

# This is a Data Science Assignment to aid complete analysis of online Shopping behavior. This exercise is analysis intensive!

## The data set for this assignment is from "Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset Data Set" https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset
## The goal is to develop Machine Learning Models to present a complete analysis for online shopping behavior data set.
